<h2>wireframing</h2>
<p>Wirefrming is a process of creating the layout/user interface of a project using creative tools like figma</p>
<p>It is important in the deign process for:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Visualizing Structure and Layout</li>
    <li>Focusing on Functionality and Content</li>
    <li>Facilitating Early Feedback and Iteration</li>
    <li>Improving Communication and Collaboration</li>
    <li>Defining Information Hierarchy</li>
    <li>Planning User Flows and Interactions</li>
    <li>Estimating Development Effort</li>
</ol>

<h2>Key elements found in a wireframe</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Layout Structure:</strong> The layout structure functions as the skeletal framework of a wireframe, defining a consistent grid and spatial hierarchy that aligns every element on the page. By establishing columns, margins, and whitespace, it dictates how components relate proportionally and visually, guiding the designer to allocate emphasis and balance across the interface.</li>
    <li><strong>Navigation:</strong> Navigation in a wireframe represents the pathways through which users traverse the interface. Whether manifested as a persistent header, sidebar, or contextual links, it signals the available sections and current location, ensuring that users can effortlessly move between high-level areas and dive deeper into specific content without losing their sense of place.</li>
    <li><strong>Content Placement:</strong> Content placement determines the positioning of text, images, and interactive widgets within the established grid, orchestrating visual flow and cognitive load. By clustering related information into clear zones and considering typical eye-movement patterns (such as F- or Z-shaped scans), it crafts a narrative order that invites users to absorb key messages in an intuitive sequence.</li>
    <li><strong>Functionality:</strong> Functionality annotations in a wireframe describe the intended behaviors and states of each interface elementâ€”buttons, form fields, carousels, error messages, and loading indicators alike. By specifying how components respond to user actions and data conditions, these notes ensure that the design team understands the dynamic interactions needed to deliver a responsive, user-centered experience.</li>
